# Top Spotify Stats and Visualization
The command-line application showcases the user's top 10 songs on Spotify and visualizes data such as Beats Per Minute (BPM) and valence through interactive graphs. It also lists the user's top artists. The process begins by requesting user authorization to access their Spotify data, after which the results are displayed.
