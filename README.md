# Top Spotify Stats and Visualization
The command-line application showcases the user's top 10 songs on Spotify and visualizes data such as Beats Per Minute (BPM) and valence through interactive graphs. It also lists the user's top artists. The process begins by requesting user authorization to access their Spotify data, after which the results are displayed.

Tech used: Python, Spotify API, Spotipy Library, Plotext, Pandas

### TODO: explain how to run it locally

## Purpose:
I wanted to get more familar with using Spotify's API and the Spotipy Library. I also wanted to see how I can visualize a track's audio features

## What I learned:
I learned about plotext for the first time and I found it very nice to have graphs be displayed on the command line. I was also not very familar about
different graphs so I was able to test multiple to see which best represents the data I have.
